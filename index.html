        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>YouTube was created in February 2005. Since its conception it has allowed almost anyone to post almost anything to any number of people. The ability to upload and share videos online has spawned a new generation of amateur film makers. These amateurs have created unique genres of video such as the unboxing video, the reaction videos and the tutorial.<br>
        <br>
        Almost 4 years after the platform began in January 2009, YouTube began allowing advertising to appear on their platform. This was the beginning of the professionalisation of amateur videos on the internet. Youtubers with large followings began to make money from their videos, some being able to sustain themselves with only this as income. With the money came equipment and with the equipment came slick, finished versions of the amateur videos that existed before.<br>
        <br>
        When you think of amateur footage you think of shots of family outings, birthdays and other special occasions. The footage is normally unstable, out of focus with the shot sometimes completely missing the subject it was intended to film. But today when anyone can have a home studio, a high quality camera and an editing suite what does it mean to be an amateur?<br>
        <br>
        Amateur video has existed since the video camera became an accessible tool for documenting life for the masses. Since its conception it has been inextricably linked to social and political relations as well as technological production. Patricia R Zimmerman says “amateur film occupies one of the central contradictions of commu­nications in the twentieth century: on the one hand,domination and consump­tion; on the other, resistance and hope.”<br> 
        <br>
        The genre of Desktop Documentary was conceived alongside the ability to record the events on one's screen. The genre captures how we navigate and experience the world through a computer screen. As screens become an ever more prevalent part of our lives and even more so now due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this mode of film making becomes more relevant than ever.<br> 
        <br>
        The tools necessary to create a Desktop Documentary are openly available to anyone who owns a computer. This accessibility coupled with the ability to upload and share a video over the internet allows anyone to tell a story about anything that fits within the constraints of a screen. The mode of making these types of video is also one that can be done instantly and without much preparation. No studio, lighting or cameras. The content is at your fingertips and you are the director poised over the record button.</p>
